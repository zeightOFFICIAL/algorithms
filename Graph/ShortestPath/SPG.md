# Dijkstra
Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph search algorithm that solves the shortest path problem in a graph with non-negative edge weights, producing a shortest path tree. The algorithm maintains a set of vertices whose shortest distance from the source node is already known. Initially, the set contains only the source node with distance 0, and the distance to all other nodes is set to infinity. The algorithm then iteratively selects the vertex with the smallest distance from the source node from the set of vertices whose shortest distance is not yet known. The distance to each of its neighboring vertices is then updated, and the neighbor vertices are added to the set if not already present. This process continues until the shortest distance to the target node is known, or all reachable nodes have been processed. The result is a shortest path tree that represents the shortest paths from the source to all other nodes in the graph. If there are negative edges in the graph, then Dijkstra's algorithm may not produce the correct result, as it assumes non-negative edge weights. In that case, the Bellman-Ford algorithm can be used instead.

# Floyd-Warshall
Floyd-Warshall is an algorithm used to find the shortest path between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph. The algorithm works by iteratively considering all possible intermediate vertices in a path and updating the distance between pairs of vertices accordingly. Specifically, the algorithm maintains a distance matrix D where D[i][j] represents the shortest distance between vertex i and vertex j found so far. Initially, the matrix is filled with the weights of the edges in the graph. Then, for each possible intermediate vertex k, the algorithm updates D[i][j] as min(D[i][j], D[i][k] + D[k][j]). This process is repeated for all possible values of k until all pairs of vertices have been considered.

The Floyd-Warshall algorithm is notable for being able to handle negative edge weights, as long as there are no negative cycles in the graph. It is also very easy to implement, with a time complexity of O(n^3) where n is the number of vertices in the graph.

# Johnson
Johnson's algorithm is a graph algorithm that finds the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted directed graph. It is an improvement over the Floyd-Warshall algorithm as it can handle negative edge weights. The algorithm works by first adding a new vertex and connecting it to all other vertices in the graph with zero-weight edges. It then applies the Bellman-Ford algorithm to this new graph to obtain the vertex weights. The weights are then adjusted to remove the bias introduced by the zero-weight edges, and the Dijkstra algorithm is applied to each vertex to obtain the shortest path to all other vertices. The resulting paths are the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices. Johnson's algorithm has a time complexity of O(V^2 log V + VE), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph.
