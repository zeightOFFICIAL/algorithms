# Kahan summation
Kahan summation is a technique used to minimize numerical errors that can occur when adding a large number of floating-point values. The problem with naive summation is that floating-point arithmetic is not exact, and the accumulated errors can grow as the number of values being added increases. Kahan summation addresses this problem by keeping track of the rounding errors and adding them to the next value being added.

The basic idea behind Kahan summation is to use a separate variable to keep track of the accumulated error, and add this error to the next value being added. This helps to cancel out the error introduced in the previous addition. The algorithm keeps track of the sum and the error separately, and at the end of the loop, adds the error back to the sum.

Kahan summation is particularly useful when adding a large number of values that have widely varying magnitudes. In such cases, the error in the smaller values can be completely lost in the accumulated error of the larger values. Kahan summation helps to minimize this effect, and produce a more accurate result.

Although Kahan summation adds some extra overhead compared to naive summation, the improved accuracy can be worth the cost in many applications.

# Squaring exponentiation
Squaring exponentiation, also known as binary exponentiation, is an algorithm for computing an exponentiation operation in a more efficient way than repeated multiplication. It is based on the idea that any power of a number can be expressed as a binary expansion of the exponent.

This algorithm reduces the number of multiplications required to compute a^b from b to log_2(b), making it much more efficient for large exponents. The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log b), where b is the exponent, and the space complexity is O(1).
