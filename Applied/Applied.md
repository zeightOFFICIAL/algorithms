# Meeus 
Meeus' Orthodox Easter is an algorithm for calculating the date of Easter in the Julian calendar, which is used by the Eastern Orthodox Church. The algorithm is based on the work of the astronomer Jean Meeus and uses a series of astronomical calculations to determine the date of the first full moon after the spring equinox.

The algorithm consists of several steps, including calculating the Golden Number, which is a number that identifies the position of the year in the 19-year Metonic cycle. The Metonic cycle is a period of 19 years after which the phases of the moon repeat on the same days of the year.

Once the Golden Number is calculated, the next step is to determine the date of the spring equinox for that year. This is done using a series of astronomical calculations based on the position of the sun in the sky.

With the date of the spring equinox determined, the next step is to calculate the date of the full moon that occurs on or after the equinox. This is done using a series of calculations based on the position of the moon in the sky.

Finally, the date of Easter is calculated as the first Sunday that follows the full moon after the spring equinox.

The algorithm is relatively complex and requires a good understanding of astronomy and mathematics to implement correctly. However, it provides an accurate and reliable method for calculating the date of Easter in the Julian calendar, which is used by millions of people around the world.

# Meeus/Jones/Butcher
Meeus/Jones/Butcher is a set of algorithms for computing the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets. The algorithms are based on the work of Jean Meeus, Paul Schlyter, and Peter Duffett-Smith. They are widely used in astronomical software and are known for their accuracy and efficiency.

The algorithms are divided into two main categories: those for the Sun and those for the Moon and planets. The algorithms for the Sun are based on the work of Meeus, while those for the Moon and planets are based on the work of Jones and Butcher.

The algorithms for the Sun include the Meeus method for the position of the Sun and the Meeus method for the equation of time. The former is used to calculate the position of the Sun in the sky, while the latter is used to convert between solar time and clock time. Both algorithms are based on the position of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun.

The algorithms for the Moon and planets include the Jones and Butcher method for the position of the Moon, the Meeus method for the position of the planets, and the Meeus method for the phases of the Moon. The Jones and Butcher method is used to calculate the position of the Moon in the sky, while the Meeus method for the planets is used to calculate the position of the planets. The Meeus method for the phases of the Moon is used to calculate the phase of the Moon based on its position relative to the Sun and Earth.

Overall, the Meeus/Jones/Butcher algorithms are highly regarded in the astronomical community for their accuracy and efficiency. They have been widely implemented in astronomical software and are considered to be among the most reliable and precise algorithms for calculating the positions of celestial bodies.

# Zeller's congruence
Zeller's congruence is a mathematical formula that allows the determination of the day of the week for a given date. It was developed by Christian Zeller in the late 19th century and is based on modular arithmetic.

The formula takes as input three integers representing the year, month, and day of the date in question. It then computes a number representing the day of the week, where 0 corresponds to Saturday, 1 to Sunday, and so on up to 6 for Friday. The formula works for any date after the introduction of the Gregorian calendar in 1582.
